## Proposal

### What is your project?

My project is an app that allows you to keep track of your houseplants/gardens. It will allow you to at a glance see how much water it needs, how much sunlight, and if youve kept up with it so far.

### Wireframes!

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

### Initial thoughts on app structure

Getting my user list of their plants and the api with all plants to interact in a friendly way will be a challenge. User Auth will also likely be a challenge. Getting the user to be able search through the api's effictively.

### Phases of Completion

-Phase one:
building out the database for the user and their plants as well as reading through the fetch documentation for the plant app.
-Phase two:
building my server and trying to deploy it.
--Phase Three:
Build out routres
